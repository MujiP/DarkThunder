# Bolusaur Python Backend

This is the backend for our app. It is currently hosted on Heroku at https://darkthunder-1.herokuapp.com and uses Redis Cloud Free, which gives us 30MB of storage.

To see all events in a category, send a GET request to https://darkthunder-1.herokuapp.com/events. You can also visit the page in your browser. 

You can post an event by sending a POST request to https://darkthunder-1.herokuapp.com/events. Event information should be sent in the request body as a JSON object. 

There are no required fields. The "people" and "tags" fields accept lists of strings. "maxOccupancy" should be an int if specified. "id" is generated by the server.

To add a new person to an event, send a POST request to https://darkthunder-1.herokuapp.com/join/{event_id}/{person_id}. Fails if the event does not exist (HTTP 404) or if the number of people is >= the event's "maxOccupancy" field.

To remove a person from an event, send a POST request to https://darkthunder-1.herokuapp.com/leave/{event_id}/{person_id}.
